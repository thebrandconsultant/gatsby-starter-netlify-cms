### **Our methodology is based on 3 core phases:**

1. **Information** - Finding and harnessing factual data around a key issue using BrandWatch software 
2. **Action** – Analysing the data and strategically planning how to balance the conversation and change behaviours around the issue, this could be online or on-the-ground campaigns using traditional media
3. **Impact** – ensuring all our messaging and communication interventions are effective and provoke a change of hearts, minds and ultimately negative behaviours

Underpinning our methodology are our Core Values, which guide every aspect of what we do and how we do it.
