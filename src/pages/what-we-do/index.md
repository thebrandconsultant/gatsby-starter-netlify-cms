At the same time that social media is being used to misinform and divide the public on fundamental issues, we use it to harness data, analyse conversations and find where narrative manipulation is happening. This qualitative data guides our insights into how we can start a new dialogue, educating on facts and raising awareness of the truth the public deserve to know, so they can make informed decisions. Currently, we are working in the anti-racism narrative manipulation space but there are a multitude of issues that we will be problem-solving that will require funding. These include:

* Gender Based Violence Gender Equality 
* Homophobia & LGBTQI human rights issues
* Climate Change denialism
* Climate & Energy Sustainability 
* Xenophobia (and forecasting xenophobic violence)
